## Features

## How It Works

1. The participant enters their team name in the input box.  
2. The system checks the entered name against a list of eligible teams.  
3. If the team is eligible:
   - The certificate image is displayed.
   - The team name appears dynamically on the certificate (around 33% from the top).  
4. If not eligible, a message is shown indicating the team is not eligible.
